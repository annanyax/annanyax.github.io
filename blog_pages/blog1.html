        <p>Welcome to the wild ride of impostor syndrome, a.k.a., the never-ending game of <strong>"Who let me adult today?"</strong></p>

        <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/6142245093315b0f29d7878a/615c6847f4abda7bf5eb05b2_imposter%20syndrome%201.jpg" target="_blank">

        <p>It’s the annoying little gremlin that shows up just when you think you’ve got it all figured out. The ultimate sidekick to your self-doubt, and let’s be honest, it’s probably more loyal than your best friend. Because no matter how much you achieve, it’s right there, sipping on your confidence and saying, <em>"Wait, you? Really?"</em></p>

        <h2>Humility vs. Impostor Syndrome</h2>

        <p>Let’s get one thing straight: being humble is great. But when does humility cross into, <em>“Did I just trick everyone into thinking I’m an expert?”</em> It’s that fun moment when you’re in a meeting, nodding along like, <em>“Yes, I too understand these complex spreadsheets,”</em> while internally screaming, <strong>“I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I’M DOING!”</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> pretty much everyone feels this at some point. Even the "experts."</p>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>

        <p>Did you know that around 70% of people have experienced impostor syndrome at least once in their life? So, yes, you’re not special. (But in a good way!) Basically, even the most competent-looking person is probably two steps away from Googling <em>“how to adult”</em> and <em>“how do meetings even work?”</em></p>

        <p>We’re all just making it up as we go. Even if I look confident on the outside, rest assured I’m likely second-guessing every word I just typed (yes, even this one). So, if you're feeling like you’re one awkward slip-up away from being found out as a total fraud, congratulations—you’re part of the club! ✨</p>

        <h2>Here’s the Deal</h2>

        <p>If you’re waiting to feel like you’ve really got your life together, don’t hold your breath. It’s fine to have no clue what you’re doing. None of us do. But the trick is, we’re all really good at pretending.</p>

        <p>Now, back to sending that email with sweaty palms.</p>
